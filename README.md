# Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration, tailored to my preferences and workflow.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Neovim installed on your system. You can find installation instructions for your platform on the [Neovim website](https://neovim.io/doc/user/install.html).

2. Clone this repository to your desired location:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oleksiiluchnikov/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

## Usage

After installing the configuration, Neovim will load the settings and plugins specified in the configuration files. You can customize the configuration further by modifying the files in the `~/.config/nvim` directory.

## User Preferences

This Neovim setup prioritizes AI-assisted coding with multiple completion engines (Blink, Supermaven, Copilot, Avante), efficient navigation (smart window switching with arrow keys, context-aware movement), and productivity enhancements. It uses Lazy.nvim for plugin management, the catppuccin colorscheme, and custom keymaps for AI suggestion acceptance (<C-y> for word, <C-j> for full) and CodeCompanion chat integration.
